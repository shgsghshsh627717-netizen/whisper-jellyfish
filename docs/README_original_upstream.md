An intelligent voice transcription input tool supporting multiple transcription services and high-quality speech recognition features.

> 🐧 **Linux users:** Linux desktop support lives on the [`linux` branch](https://github.com/Mor-Li/Whisper-Input-Next/tree/linux), kindly contributed and maintained by [@MiaoDX](https://github.com/MiaoDX) — many thanks! I'm on macOS and don't personally test/maintain the branch, so it may lag behind `main`. Track or contribute there.

## 💰 Why Pay $12/Month? Use Open Source Instead!

**Typeless charges $12/month** for their voice keyboard, but you know what? This open-source project does the same thing for **FREE** - you only pay for the underlying API costs (Doubao ASR or OpenAI GPT-4o transcribe), which is incredibly cheap compared to Typeless's subscription.

- Typeless: $144/year subscription + you don't own the service
- **Whisper-Input-Next**: $0 + only pay for what you use (Doubao streaming ASR is super cheap!)

Stop renting your tools. Own them.

## 🚀 Project Background

This project is based on [ErlichLiu/Whisper-Input](https://github.com/ErlichLiu/Whisper-Input) for secondary development. The original project has been inactive for months, so we have made extensive feature expansions and architectural optimizations, adding important features like OpenAI GPT-4o transcribe integration, audio archiving, local whisper support, and more. [Why use this project?](./docs/[V3.0.0]_知乎blog.md)

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔥 NEW in v3.3.0: Two-Pass Recognition & Accuracy Boost
- **Two-Pass Recognition**: Enables `enable_nonstream` for sentence-level re-recognition using the higher-accuracy nostream model during speech pauses, significantly improving transcription quality
- **Deferred Text Output**: All text stays in floating preview during recording; final text is pasted only after recording stops, allowing full ASR context optimization
- **DJI Wireless Mic Support**: Auto-detects and prioritizes DJI Wireless Microphone as input device

### Doubao Streaming ASR (since v3.2.0)
- **Real-time Streaming Transcription**: Powered by ByteDance's Doubao Seed ASR 2.0, transcription appears as you speak
- **Floating Preview Window**: Shows pending text in real-time near your input field, like an IME
- **Now Default for Ctrl+F**: The best voice input experience, set as default (configurable)
- 👉 [How to get your API keys](#how-to-get-doubao-api-keys)

### 🎯 Core Functions
- **Multi-platform Transcription Services**: Doubao Streaming ASR (default), OpenAI GPT-4o transcribe, local whisper.cpp
- **Smart Hotkeys**: Ctrl+F (Doubao streaming, default) / Ctrl+I (local cost-saving mode)
- **Audio Archive**: Automatically save all recordings, support history playback
- **Failure Retry**: Intelligent error handling and retry mechanism

### 🔧 Technical Features
- **Dual Processor Architecture**: Streaming + Batch processors working simultaneously
- **180s Long Audio Support**: Support up to 3 minutes of continuous recording
- **Smart Status Indicators**: Simple numeric status display (0, 1, !)
- **Cache System**: Audio archive with transcription result caching

### 🌟 User Experience
- **No Clipboard Pollution**: Clean status display without interfering with system clipboard
- **One-click Retry**: Failed transcriptions can be retried without re-recording
- **Real-time Input**: Transcription results appear directly at cursor position
- **Privacy Protection**: Local processing option, data not uploaded

## 📦 Quick Start

```

4. **Install Local whisper.cpp (Optional, required for local transcription)**
```bash
# Clone whisper.cpp repository
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.git
cd whisper.cpp

# Compile (macOS/Linux)
make

./start.sh
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes

**Required Configuration:**
- `OFFICIAL_OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI GPT-4o transcribe API key

2. Download large-v3 model: `bash ./models/download-ggml-model.sh large-v3`
3. Configure correct paths in .env

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### Environment Variable Configuration

Configure the following parameters in the `.env` file:

```bash
# ============ Doubao Streaming ASR (Recommended, Default) ============
# Get your API keys from Volcengine Console (see screenshot below)
DOUBAO_APP_KEY=your_app_id_here        # APP ID from console
DOUBAO_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_token_here  # Access Token from console

# Transcription service selection: "doubao" (default, streaming) or "openai" (batch)
TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE=doubao

# ============ OpenAI Configuration (Optional, for batch mode) ============
OFFICIAL_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxx

```

<a id="how-to-get-doubao-api-keys"></a>
**How to get Doubao API keys**:

1. Go to [Volcengine Console - Speech Recognition](https://console.volcengine.com/ark/region:ark+cn-beijing/tts/speechRecognition)
2. Find your **APP ID** and **Access Token** in the "服务接口认证信息" section (see screenshot below)

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/volcengine_doubao_api_keys.png" alt="Volcengine Doubao API Keys" width="800" />
</p>

**Important Notes**:
- **Doubao Streaming ASR** is now the default and recommended transcription service
- Set `TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE=openai` to use OpenAI batch mode instead

### Quick Start with Aliases (Recommended)

Add these aliases to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
alias whisper_input='cd /path/to/Whisper-Input-Next && ./start.sh'
alias whisper_input_off='tmux kill-session -t whisper-input'
```

Replace `/path/to/Whisper-Input-Next` with your actual project path.

### Hotkey Instructions

| Hotkey | Function | Service | Features |
|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| `Ctrl+F` | **Real-time streaming transcription** | Doubao Seed ASR 2.0 (default) | Ultra-low latency, floating preview, text appears as you speak |
| `Ctrl+I` | Local transcription | whisper.cpp | Offline processing, privacy protection |

> **Note**: Set `TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE=openai` in `.env` to use OpenAI GPT-4o transcribe instead of Doubao for Ctrl+F.

### Status Indicators

The program displays concise status indicators at the cursor position during runtime:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `0` | Recording | Press hotkey again to stop recording |
| `1` | Transcribing | Please wait for transcription to complete |
| `!` | Transcription failed/error | Press `Ctrl+F` again to retry (audio saved) |

**Design Optimizations**:
- Use concise numeric status, avoid complex emoji symbols
- No system clipboard pollution, display only at cursor position
- Clear and intuitive status, easy to quickly identify

**Retry Mechanism Instructions**:
- When transcription fails, the system saves the recording and displays `!` status
- No need to re-record, simply press `Ctrl+F` to retry
- Retry uses previously saved audio until transcription succeeds

### 🧪 Experimental Features History

#### iOS Keyboard Extension Experiment (August 14, 2025)
**Status**: ❌ Discontinued due to Apple's restrictions  
Attempted to create iOS keyboard extension but discovered that even Sogou Input Method cannot directly record audio in keyboard extensions due to Apple's system limitations. iOS voice input is currently not feasible as a seamless keyboard extension.
